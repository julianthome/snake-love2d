## A Snake Game written in Lua and LÖVE

### Installation 

This game assumes working installations of Lua and LÖVE to be present. You can find the installation instructions for Lua and LÖVE on https://www.lua.org/ as well as https://love2d.org/, respectively.

Afterwards you should be able to start the game by just invoking `./run.sh` from this directory.

[This Golem.de article](https://www.golem.de/news/spieleklassiker-snake-programmieren-mit-lua-und-loeve-2305-174483.html) explains implementation in detail.
